Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

Outcomes 🎉


Design Your Own Class! 🏗️
Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).
Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!
Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.
Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.

Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭
Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" 🚗, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ✈️).
